<li>Be inspired, every day</li>
<li>Take your career in exciting and rewarding directions at one of the world’s top 80 universities</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone needs a platform to launch a satisfying career. At Monash, we give you the space and support to take your career in all kinds of exciting new directions with access to quality research, infrastructure and learning facilities. We’re a university full of energetic and enthusiastic minds, driven to challenge what’s expected, expand what we know, and learn from other inspiring, empowering thinkers. Innovative, supportive, successful and with great breadth and depth of talent, Monash Information Technology is a leader in research and education. We provide an ideal environment in which to excel and are located in Melbourne, one of the world’s most liveable cities.</p>

<h2 id="the-opportunity">The Opportunity</h2>

<p>An exciting opportunity has opened up within our world-class Faculty of Information Technology for one Research Fellow to conduct research as part of our leading-edge research. The Research Fellow will work on the DARPA project &ndash; &ldquo;Learning with Less Labels (LwLL)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In supervised machine learning (ML), the ML system learns by example to recognize things, such as objects in images or speech. Humans provide these examples to ML systems during their training in the form of labeled data. With enough labeled data, we can generally build accurate pattern recognition models.</p>

<p>The problem is that training accurate models currently requires lots of labeled data. For tasks like machine translation, speech recognition or object recognition, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the state of the art, due to the superior accuracy they can achieve. To gain this advantage over other techniques, however, DNN models need more data, typically requiring 109 or 1010 labeled training examples to achieve good performance.</p>

<p>The commercial world has harvested and created large sets of labeled data for training models. These datasets are often created via crowdsourcing: a cheap and efficient way to create labeled data. Unfortunately, crowdsourcing techniques are often not possible for proprietary or sensitive data. Creating data sets for these sorts of problems can result in 100x higher costs and 50x longer time to label.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, machine learning models are brittle, in that their performance can degrade severely with small changes in their operating environment. For instance, the performance of computer vision systems degrades when data is collected from a new sensor and new collection viewpoints. Similarly, dialog and text understanding systems are very sensitive to changes in formality and register. As a result, additional labels are needed after initial training to adapt these models to new environments and data collection conditions. For many problems, the labeled data required to adapt models to new environments approaches the amount required to train a new model from scratch.</p>

<p>The Learning with Less Labels (LwLL) program aims to make the process of training machine learning models more efficient by reducing the amount of labeled data required to build a model by six or more orders of magnitude, and by reducing the amount of data needed to adapt models to new environments to tens to hundreds of labeled examples.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the massive reductions of labeled data needed to train accurate models, the LwLL program will focus on two technical objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Development of learning algorithms that learn and adapt efficiently; and</li>
<li>Formally characterize machine learning problems and prove the limits of learning and adaptation.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be successful in securing these exciting opportunities you will have a doctoral qualification within Computer Science, or equivalent qualifications or research experience; demonstrated knowledge within the respective areas; and a burning desire to work alongside the premier academics in the field producing world-class research.</p>

<p>The faculty is strongly committed to improving the diversity of our staff and students, and promoting a culture of equity, fairness, respect and openness. We fully support the gender equity principles of the Athena SWAN Charter.</p>

<p>At Monash University, we are committed to being a Child Safe organisation. Some positions at the University may require the incumbent to hold a valid Working with Children Check.</p>
